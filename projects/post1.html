                <h2>Concept & Intent</h2>
                <p>
                    Going into this exercise, I did not start with a predefined emotional outcome.
                    Instead, my initial intent was simply to work with an existing video.
                    I chose a video of my dogs playing together because it was easily accessible and emotionally
                    meaningful,
                    allowing me to focus more on learning TouchDesigner rather than sourcing new
                    content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I began building the network and experimenting with interaction and color,
                    the emotional direction of the project developed naturally. The contrast
                    between red and blue, combined with the crossfading interaction, began to
                    suggest feelings of fear and sadness. These moods were not fully planned from
                    the beginning but emerged through testing, adjustment, and aesthetic
                    decision-making during the process.

                <h2>Process of Creating this Exercise</h2>
                <ol class="process-list">
                    <li>
                        I started by choosing my video, which was footage of my dogs playing together
                        when my second dog was still a puppy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, I added two Movie File In TOPs and connected each of them to separate
                        Ramp TOPs. I changed the colors of the ramps so I could clearly see what was
                        being output when I connected the two Ramp TOPs to a Cross TOP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third, I added a Mouse In CHOP and connected it to the Cross TOP. I didn’t like
                        how the transition felt at first, so I added a Math CHOP between them and
                        experimented with the multiply value. I found that a value of 4 worked best,
                        so I kept it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After that, I experimented with the ramp colors and found that I liked blue
                        and red the most.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, I added two Text TOPs and connected them to the ramps and then to the
                        Cross TOP. I used bold text so the words were still visible even though they
                        matched the background color. The red reminded me of wolves, since dogs are
                        domesticated wolves, so the red text became “Gory Wolves.” For the blue, I was
                        originally aiming for gray, but blue worked better to express sadness and
                        nostalgia, referencing the “Good Old Times” and how fun they were. Overall,
                        the emotions I wanted to convey were sadness and fear.

                </ol>
