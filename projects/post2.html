                <h2>Concept & Intent</h2>
                <p>
                    For this assignment, I needed to use containers with two different controls that affect a video,
                    while incorporating the color blue.My Network Flow was as followes: Movie File In TOP → Level TOP →
                    Fit TOP → Out TOP, with
                    Slider/Button controlling parameters through CHOP exports.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>Process of Creating this Exercise</h2>
                <ol class="process-list">
                    <li>
                        First I made a container where it will have the controls and the effects my video will
                        have.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inside the container, I added a Button COMP and a Slider COMP. Connected them both to a Math
                        CHOP. I also added a moviefilein TOP for the video and connected it to an Out TOP so it could
                        displayed at the top level window COMP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next I started looking at different effects that I knew I could make blue without much struggle
                        and I found TOP level. Then I experiment with the Level TOP options and making the color blue
                        prominently I liked the inverted one the best and connected it with my
                        math that is connected with the slider so did that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I had a button and I was not loving much options with the level and was looking at brightness
                        but didn't like the 0-1 brightness so I made the math range from 0-1 to 1-2 so it wouldn't be
                        dark on my video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I then started working in the upper part and connected the container to null TOP then reference
                        another container called container_content with background param of null1. Both the container1
                        and container_content were connected to a third container named controls_content. Then I have
                        the window reference the controls_content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then I saw that the controls were not showing up in my container called controls_content and
                        decided inside the container1 where the movie comes from to add a TOP fit between the TOP level
                        and TOP out. I set the fit resolution to 1280 by 720 and it was fixed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then in the upper level where the three containers are I did some adjustments with the
                        containers, window and null. For Container 1 I set height to 200 , width was still 400. I align
                        container1 children top to bottom. For container_content I made the width to 1280 and height to
                        720. The background TOP still reference the null1. For controls_content I set width 1680 and
                        height 720. Had controls_content children align left to right.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly I adjust the window COMP I justify Horizontal Right.
                    </li>
                </ol>
